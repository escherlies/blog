Today [pinpox](https://github.com/pinpox) posted this fun game called [https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) into our group chat with the message "here you go, so that you don't get anything productive done today either".

Lo and behold... He was right. I let my inner child out to play and wrote a little script, using an exhaustive search to find all the crafts there were until the 3rd generation.

Here are my favorites so far:

```
Stone 🪨 + Fjord 🏞️ = Troll 👹
Lily 🌸 + Fjord 🏞️ = Nymph 🧚
Lily 🌸 + Seaweed 🌊 = Mermaid 🧜‍♀️
Engine 🚗 + Pollen 🌱 = Bee 🐝
```

The result is documented here:

So, Who will run the 4th generation?

PS: I also used this occasion to publish my first blog post. As they say, start reallyyyyyyyy smallllllllll. (Whoever they are? I think it has something todo woth microhabits or else)
