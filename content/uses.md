I'm a full-stack web developer and this is the stuff I use for my  daily work.

## Software

- [Colemak Mod-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) keyboard layout on a split keyboard
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) terminal
- [Amethyst](https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst) window manager
- [AltTab](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos) for better window switching
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on desktop. Because it just works :P
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) on shell
- [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/)
- [Justfile](https://github.com/casey/just): Just a better command runner.

## Hardware

- MacBook Pro M1 Max, 32GB, 1TB
- Nyquist Split-Keyboard by [Keebio](https://keeb.io/collections/nyquist-keyboard-collection), with Big Bang 2.0 keycaps. Honestly, the best thing of a split keyboard is that I can put a bowl or plate of food in the middle.

## Stack & Languages

<small>⚔️ I'm a Verfechter<sup>[1](#1)</sup> of the functional programming stuff. (Simply because there is *fun* in <i>fun</i>ctinoal programming but there is no *fun* in object oriented programming)</small>
